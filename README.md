## BioInsights Daily — AI Agent for High-Impact Biotechnology Discoveries

BioInsights Daily is an AI-powered research intelligence agent that delivers the most important breakthroughs, regulatory updates, and discoveries in biotechnology, genomics, AI-biology, synthetic biology, and precision medicine.

It scans trusted scientific sources, filters out noise, ranks each discovery, and outputs a clean, structured intelligence brief within seconds.

## 🔬 Why This Exists

Biotech generates thousands of papers, preprints, clinical updates, and regulatory announcements every day.
Most researchers, students, and professionals cannot keep up.

BioInsights Daily solves this by acting as your AI Research Analyst, delivering only the highest-impact discoveries in a clear, digestible format.

## 🚀 Key Features

Curated scanning of PubMed, Nature, Science, Cell, bioRxiv, medRxiv, FDA and major biotech R&D feeds

Aggressive filtering to eliminate low-value or noisy data

Impact scoring (1–5) based on novelty, evidence, translational value

Classification (peer-reviewed / preprint / clinical / regulatory)

Expert interpretation written in scientific tone

Output formatted as a biotech intelligence brief

## 🛠 How It Works

The agent uses:

A structured system prompt

Curated RSS and web sources

Retrieval + filtering logic

Domain-specific scoring rubric

AI-generated analytical commentary

## 🧠 Additional Capabilities

Although BioInsights Daily is primarily designed to deliver high-impact biotechnology discoveries, it can also respond to a broad range of domain-specific prompts, including:

Summaries of individual research papers (PubMed, Nature, bioRxiv)

FDA approval explanations and regulatory breakdowns

CRISPR and gene-editing updates

Synthetic biology and AI-biology insights

Oncology, immunology and precision-medicine highlights

Comparative analysis of multiple papers

Trend detection across biotechnology fields

Explanations of techniques, methods and biological concepts

Drug development pipeline updates

Custom intelligence briefs for a specific disease or technology

These extended capabilities make BioInsights Daily useful not only for daily updates, but also for deeper research exploration, literature review, academic assistance, and industry-level analysis.
