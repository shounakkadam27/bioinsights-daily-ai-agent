# How BioInsights Daily Works

BioInsights Daily is a domain-specific AI agent designed to function like a biotechnology research analyst and give you up-to-date news on the latest discoveries in the biotechnology sector

## 1. Source Monitoring
The agent scans trusted scientific sources:
- PubMed RSS feeds
- Nature Biology RSS
- Science & Cell updates
- bioRxiv / medRxiv preprints
- FDA approval releases
- Major biotech company press rooms

## 2. Filtering Logic
The agent removes:
- Non-biotech topics
- Low-evidence claims
- Weak preprints
- Duplicate stories
- Hype-driven media articles
- Company PR without data

## 3. Scoring System
Each update is scored from 1–5 based on:
- Novelty  
- Strength of evidence  
- Clinical or translational relevance  
- Real-world impact  
- Validation level  

## 4. Structured Output
Every brief includes:
- Headline  
- What happened (3 bullets)  
- Why it matters (2 bullets)  
- Domain impact  
- Evidence score  
- Original source link  
- Expert interpretation  

## 5. AI Analysis Layer
The agent:
- Reads the study  
- Extracts data  
- Summarises findings  
- Contextualises implications  
- Highlights limitations  

This transforms raw papers into actionable biotech intelligence.
